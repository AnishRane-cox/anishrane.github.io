<br>Hello! I’m **Anish Nilesh Rane**, a Generative AI and Machine Learning Engineer passionate about transforming real-world
challenges into intelligent, scalable solutions.

<br>My journey began in **mechanical engineering**, designing hydraulic systems and CAD models, but curiosity pulled me
deeper into **data, automation, and AI-driven products**. Today, I bridge these worlds, engineering precision with AI
innovation, to build solutions that are not only technically sound but also business-impactful.

## My Story

I’m currently working as an **Application Engineer – Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning at Weichai Power**, a
global leader in diesel engines, new energy solutions, and intelligent manufacturing.

<br>At Weichai, my role revolves around designing **AI-driven tools** that accelerate engineering workflows, improve
decision-making, and drive operational efficiency. Whether it’s predictive maintenance models that reduce downtime,
CAD-Llama–powered digital twins, or cloud-integrated dashboards connecting sales and engineering, I thrive at the
intersection of **AI, automation, Research and Development and manufacturing**.

<br>Weichai’s mission is to push the boundaries of mobility and power systems, and I am proud to contribute by making their
processes smarter, faster, and more adaptive.

## What I Build

-   <br>**AI-Driven Dashboards**: Python + SQL systems powered by open-source LLMs like Llama 3.1, cutting response times by
    35%.
-   <br>**RAG Search Engines**: Technical knowledge bases (Qwen2:0.5B) that boost query accuracy by 60%.
-   <br>**Predictive Maintenance Models**: LSTM networks that proactively minimize failures and save resources.
-   <br>**Digital Twin Integrations**: CAD models in CATIA/SolidWorks merged with AI for manufacturability and anomaly
    detection.
-   <br>**Automation Pipelines**: Cloud-hosted (AWS) tools streamlining invoices, templates, and inventory forecasting.

<br>In short: I design **end-to-end AI ecosystems** from research to production with measurable impact.

## Projects I’m Proud Of

-   <br>**Insurance Policy Chatbot (2025):** Built a GPT-powered retrieval pipeline with embeddings and dual-stage retrieval
    for grounded Q&A.
-   <br>**Travel Planner Bot (2024):** Integrated GPT with Amadeus + weather APIs to deliver personalized, real-time
    itineraries.
-   <br>**Gesture Recognition (2023):** 3D-CNN + ConvLSTM achieving 78% validation accuracy for human-computer interaction.
-   <br>**Semantic Fake News Detection (2023):** Word2Vec + logistic regression pipeline with 91% accuracy and strong F1
    performance.
-   <br>**Bike Demand Prediction (2023):** MLR model (R² = 0.82) for rental inventory optimization.

<br>Each project reflects my love for tackling problems where **data meets human experience**.

## Skills That Define Me

-   <br>**Machine Learning & AI:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, LLM fine-tuning, RAG pipelines.
-   <br>**Data & Analytics:** Pandas, NumPy, SQL/NoSQL, Power BI, advanced visualization.
-   <br>**Cloud & MLOps:** AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD for AI solutions.
-   <br>**Programming:** Python (my go-to), R, C++, JavaScript.
-   <br>**Engineering Roots:** CAD modeling, hydraulic systems, DFA/DFM principles.

<br>What makes me different is not just technical depth, but the ability to **translate complexity into clarity**, aligning
AI solutions with business impact.

## Education & Growth

-   <br>**PG Diploma in Machine Learning & AI** – IIIT, First-Class with Distinction
-   <br>**B.E. Mechanical Engineering** – SPPU, First-Class with Distinction
-   <br>**Diploma in Mechanical Engineering** – MSBTE, First-Class with Distinction

<br>I believe learning is never done. My growth has always come from pushing boundaries, experimenting with new tools, and
blending my engineering foundation with modern AI capabilities.

## Beyond Work

<br>When I’m not debugging code or optimizing neural nets, you’ll probably find me:

-   <br>Sketching ideas for new AI tools.
-   <br>Breaking down complex concepts into teaching content.
-   <br>Exploring how AI can merge with **mobility, manufacturing, and smart energy** — fields where companies like Weichai
    are already leading the charge.
