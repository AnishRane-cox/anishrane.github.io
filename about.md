Hello! I’m **Anish Nilesh Rane**, a Generative AI and Machine Learning Engineer passionate about transforming real-world challenges into intelligent, scalable solutions.

My journey began in **mechanical engineering**, designing hydraulic systems and CAD models, but curiosity pulled me deeper into **data, automation, and AI-driven products**. Today, I bridge these worlds — engineering precision with AI innovation — to build solutions that are not only technically sound but also business-impactful.

## My Story

I’m currently working as an **Application Engineer – Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning at Weichai Power**, a global leader in diesel engines, new energy solutions, and intelligent manufacturing.

At Weichai, my role revolves around designing **AI-driven tools** that accelerate engineering workflows, improve decision-making, and drive operational efficiency. Whether it’s predictive maintenance models that reduce downtime, CAD-Llama–powered digital twins, or cloud-integrated dashboards connecting sales and engineering — I thrive at the intersection of **AI, automation, and manufacturing**.

Weichai’s mission is to push the boundaries of mobility and power systems, and I am proud to contribute by making their processes smarter, faster, and more adaptive.

## What I Build

- **AI-Driven Dashboards**: Python + SQL systems powered by open-source LLMs like Llama 3.1, cutting response times by 35%.
- **RAG Search Engines**: Technical knowledge bases (Qwen2:0.5B) that boost query accuracy by 60%.
- **Predictive Maintenance Models**: LSTM networks that proactively minimize failures and save resources.
- **Digital Twin Integrations**: CAD models in CATIA/SolidWorks merged with AI for manufacturability and anomaly detection.
- **Automation Pipelines**: Cloud-hosted (AWS) tools streamlining invoices, templates, and inventory forecasting.

In short: I design **end-to-end AI ecosystems** — from research to production — with measurable impact.

## Projects I’m Proud Of

- **Insurance Policy Chatbot (2025):** Built a GPT-powered retrieval pipeline with embeddings and dual-stage retrieval for grounded Q&A.
- **Travel Planner Bot (2024):** Integrated GPT with Amadeus + weather APIs to deliver personalized, real-time itineraries.
- **Gesture Recognition (2023):** 3D-CNN + ConvLSTM achieving 78% validation accuracy for human-computer interaction.
- **Semantic Fake News Detection (2023):** Word2Vec + logistic regression pipeline with 91% accuracy and strong F1 performance.
- **Bike Demand Prediction (2023):** MLR model (R² = 0.82) for rental inventory optimization.

Each project reflects my love for tackling problems where **data meets human experience**.

## Skills That Define Me

- **Machine Learning & AI:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, LLM fine-tuning, RAG pipelines.
- **Data & Analytics:** Pandas, NumPy, SQL/NoSQL, Power BI, advanced visualization.
- **Cloud & MLOps:** AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD for AI solutions.
- **Programming:** Python (my go-to), R, C++, JavaScript.
- **Engineering Roots:** CAD modeling, hydraulic systems, DFA/DFM principles.

What makes me different is not just technical depth, but the ability to **translate complexity into clarity** — aligning AI solutions with business impact.

## Education & Growth

- **PG Diploma in Machine Learning & AI** – IIIT, First-Class with Distinction
- **B.E. Mechanical Engineering** – SPPU, First-Class with Distinction
- **Diploma in Mechanical Engineering** – MSBTE, First-Class with Distinction

I believe learning is never done. My growth has always come from pushing boundaries, experimenting with new tools, and blending my engineering foundation with modern AI capabilities.

## Beyond Work

When I’m not debugging code or optimizing neural nets, you’ll probably find me:
- Sketching ideas for new AI tools.
- Breaking down complex concepts into teaching content.
- Exploring how AI can merge with **mobility, manufacturing, and smart energy** — fields where companies like Weichai are already leading the charge.
